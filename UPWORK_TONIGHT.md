### Step 3: Negotiate Fast Payment (After Hire)

**When client responds positively:**

```markdown
Great! To get started immediately:

Option 1 (Fastest - Same Day Payment):
Direct payment via Zelle/Venmo/PayPal F&F
I'll start work immediately upon receiving 50% upfront
Remaining 50% upon delivery (today)

Option 2 (Standard - 3-5 Days):
