# 🔒 Quick Answer: Use Your Bug Bounty Handle, NOT Real Name

## ⚠️ DON'T Use Real Name - Use Handle Instead

### Why:
- **OPSEC** - Protects your privacy
- **Safety** - Can't be used to find your real identity
- **Security** - If system leaks, your real name isn't exposed

### Use Instead:
- Your bug bounty handle (e.g., "DoctorMen")
- Pseudonym
- Initials + code
- Company name (if you have one)

## ✅ Quick Command

**Replace "DoctorMen" with YOUR bug bounty handle:**

```bash
cd ~/Recon-automation-Bug-bounty-stack
SYSTEM_OWNER="DoctorMen" python3 scripts/add_protection.py
```

**That's it! Your handle will be on all copyrights, not your real name.**

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Use your bug bounty handle** - It's safer, smarter, and still protects your work.

**Only use real name if you're selling as an official business entity.**
