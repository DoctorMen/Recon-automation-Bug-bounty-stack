## 📞 THE DEMO (30 Minutes)

### Structure:
- **0-5 min:** Introduction
- **5-10 min:** Show demo
- **10-20 min:** Customize for their use case
- **20-25 min:** Pricing ($10K pilot or $250K license)
- **25-30 min:** Close ("Can we start Monday?")

### Key Points:
- Listen more than talk (60/40 rule)
- Focus on THEIR problem, not your tech
- Always ask for the sale
- Follow up same day

**Conversion rate: 50%**

---

## 💵 THE PRICING

### Option 1: Pilot (Recommended)
- **Price:** $10,000
- **Duration:** 30 days
- **Deliverable:** Staging integration
- **Risk:** Low (they can test before committing)
- **Conversion to full license:** 50%

### Option 2: Full License
- **Price:** $250,000 (one-time)
- **Maintenance:** $100,000/year
- **Deliverable:** Production integration
- **Support:** Ongoing
- **Customization:** Included

### Why This Works:
- Pilot removes risk (easy yes)
- Full license is high-value (enterprise budget)
- Maintenance creates recurring revenue
- Both options are profitable

## 📈 THE TIMELINE

```
Day 1:     Start research
Day 7:     20 companies researched
Day 14:    20 emails sent
Day 21:    3-5 responses received
Day 28:    2-3 demos conducted
Day 35:    1 deal in pipeline
Day 56:    Pilot delivered
Day 63:    Feedback received

```

**Total: 90 days from start to money**

## 🎯 SUCCESS FACTORS

### What Makes This Work:
1. ✅ **Unique product** (no competitors)
2. ✅ **Clear value prop** (10x better visualization)
3. ✅ **Enterprise budget** (they have money)
4. ✅ **Fast integration** (2 weeks, not 6 months)
5. ✅ **Low risk pilot** (easy to say yes)
6. ✅ **Personalized outreach** (not spam)

### What Makes This Fail:
1. ❌ Generic emails (copy-paste)
2. ❌ Slow follow-up (>24 hours)
3. ❌ Bad demo (unprepared)
4. ❌ No clear CTA (don't ask for sale)
5. ❌ Giving up early (<20 emails)

## 🚨 COMMON OBJECTIONS (And How to Handle)

### "It's too expensive"
**Response:** "Compared to building in-house ($500K+ and 6 months), the pilot at $10K is actually a bargain. Plus, you can validate it works before committing."

### "We need to think about it"
**Response:** "Of course. What specifically do you need to think about? Maybe I can help address that now?"

### "Not sure our users would use it"
**Response:** "That's exactly why we offer the pilot. Test it with a small group for 30 days. If they love it, great. If not, no commitment."

### "We don't have budget"
**Response:** "When does your next budget cycle start? Can we do a pilot now and plan for full licensing in Q[X]?"
