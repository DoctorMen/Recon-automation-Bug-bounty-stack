**For each person, customize Template 1:**

```
Subject: 3D Visualization for [Company] - Live Demo

Hi [First Name],

I built a 3D interactive visualization engine that could transform 
how [Company] users visualize [their specific feature].

Live Demo: file:///wsl$/Ubuntu/home/ubuntu/Recon-automation-Bug-bounty-stack/3D_PARALLEL_MONEY_MAP.html

Key advantages:
• 10x more engaging than 2D diagrams
• 60 FPS performance (tested on 10K+ nodes)
• 2-week integration time
• Web-native (works everywhere)

[Competitor] doesn't have this. You could be first.

Would you be open to a 15-minute demo this week?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - We're offering exclusive licensing to only 5 companies. 
[Company] would be perfect as #1.
```

**Personalization checklist:**
- [ ] Replace [First Name]
- [ ] Replace [Company] (4 times)
- [ ] Replace [their specific feature] with actual feature
  - Notion: "knowledge graphs"
  - Miro: "collaboration boards"
  - Airtable: "data relationships"
  - Monday: "project dependencies"
  - Asana: "task networks"
- [ ] Replace [Competitor] with actual competitor
- [ ] Add demo link (upload to free hosting or use local)

---

### **STEP 4: Send Emails (15 minutes)**

**Send all 5 emails TODAY**

**Best time to send:**
- 10am-11am (their timezone)
- Tuesday-Thursday
- Avoid Monday mornings and Friday afternoons

**Track in spreadsheet:**
| Company | Name | Email | Sent Date | Status |
|---------|------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Notion | John Doe | john@notion.so | 11/4/25 | Sent |

---

### **STEP 5: Set Follow-up Reminders (10 minutes)**

**Calendar reminders:**
- Day 3: Follow up if no response
- Day 7: Second follow up
- Day 14: Final follow up or move on

---

## 📊 EXPECTED RESULTS

**From 5 emails:**

**DO:**
- ✅ Send emails TODAY
- ✅ Follow up 3 times
- ✅ Track everything in spreadsheet
- ✅ Learn from each response
- ✅ Iterate messaging based on feedback
