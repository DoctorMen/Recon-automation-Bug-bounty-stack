# CodeAware Business Plan

## Executive Summary

**CodeAware** is a SaaS platform that solves the Dunning-Kruger effect in software development by providing automated code quality assessment with awareness metrics. We help developers and organizations identify skill gaps, security vulnerabilities, and code quality issues before they become costly problems.

### The Problem

Traditional Dunning-Kruger in Coding:
1. Developers lack awareness to assess their own code quality
2. They think their spaghetti code is acceptable
3. They ship buggy, insecure, and non-scalable software
4. Reality catches up: apps break, security breaches occur, systems can't scale
5. Businesses lose money, reputation, and customer trust

### The Solution

CodeAware provides:
- **Automated Code Quality Analysis**: Real-time scanning for bugs, security issues, and anti-patterns
- **Awareness Metrics**: AI-powered assessment showing developers their actual skill level vs. perceived level
- **Skill Gap Identification**: Pinpoints exactly where developers have blind spots
- **Learning Pathways**: Customized training to address specific weaknesses
- **Business Intelligence**: Executive dashboards showing team-wide code quality and risk assessment
- **ROI Tracking**: Quantifiable metrics on code quality improvement over time
