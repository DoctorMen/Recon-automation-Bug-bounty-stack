## Demo Script

### Introduction (2 minutes)
"Thanks for your time today. Based on our conversation, I've tailored this demo to focus on [specific pain points]. We'll cover:
1. How CodeAware analyzes code quality
2. The unique awareness metrics
3. How this solves [their specific problem]

Feel free to stop me with questions at any time."

### The Problem (3 minutes)
"Let me start by showing you the problem we solve..."

**Show statistics:**
- 67% of developers overestimate their code quality
- $2.08T spent annually fixing bad code
- 83% of breaches from code vulnerabilities

**Use their language:**
"You mentioned [specific issue]. This is incredibly common because developers often don't know what they don't know."

### The Solution (15 minutes)

#### Part 1: Code Analysis (5 min)
**Show:**
1. Connect repository (GitHub/GitLab)
2. Start analysis
3. Results dashboard

**Highlight:**
- Multi-language support
- Security vulnerability detection
- Complexity metrics
- Issue categorization

**Tie to their needs:**
"Remember you mentioned [pain point]? See how this identifies [solution]?"

#### Part 2: Awareness Metrics (5 min)
**Show:**
1. Dunning-Kruger score
2. Awareness gap visualization
3. Actual vs. perceived skill

**Explain:**
"This is what makes CodeAware unique. We don't just find bugs - we show developers where their blind spots are."

**Use their example:**
"With your team of [X] developers, this helps you identify who needs training in what areas."

#### Part 3: Learning Recommendations (3 min)
**Show:**
1. Personalized learning paths
2. Resource recommendations
3. Progress tracking

**Value prop:**
"Instead of just pointing out problems, we guide developers to improve. This means [benefit to their business]."

#### Part 4: Team Dashboard (2 min) [If Team/Enterprise]
**Show:**
1. Team-wide metrics
2. Comparative analysis
3. ROI tracking

**Business value:**
"For leadership, you get visibility into team quality and can demonstrate improvement over time."

### Q&A and Next Steps (5 minutes)
"What questions do you have?"

**Always ask:**
- "Does this address your needs?"
- "What concerns do you have?"
- "What would you like to see next?"

**Propose clear next step:**
- Trial setup
- Technical deep-dive
- Stakeholder presentation
- Pilot proposal

## Objection Handling

### "We're already using [competitor]"

**Response:**
"Great! Many of our customers were using [competitor]. What prompted you to look at alternatives?"

*Listen, then position:*

"The key difference is our awareness metrics. [Competitor] finds issues, but CodeAware helps developers understand their blind spots and improve. Think of it as the difference between getting test results vs. getting test results plus a personalized improvement plan."

### "This seems expensive"

**Response:**
"I understand cost is a consideration. Let me ask - what's the current cost of your code quality issues?"

*Guide them to calculate:*
- Hours spent fixing bugs
- Production incidents
- Customer impact
- Developer time wasted

"If CodeAware reduces production bugs by just 20%, that's [calculate ROI]. What's that worth to your business?"

**For smaller budgets:**
"We have pricing tiers designed for every size. The Professional plan at $99/month might be a good starting point. What if we started there and scaled as you see value?"

### "Developers won't want to be judged"

**Response:**
"That's a common concern, and I'm glad you brought it up. Here's the thing - we position CodeAware as a growth tool, not a judgment tool."

*Emphasize:*
- Private dashboards (individual view only they see)
- Positive framing (awareness, not criticism)
- Learning focus (improvement paths)
- Optional team sharing

"In fact, most developers love it because they finally get objective feedback on where to improve, rather than vague code review comments."

### "We don't have time for another tool"

**Response:**
"I totally get it - tool fatigue is real. The good news is CodeAware actually saves time."

*Explain:*
- Automated analysis (vs manual code review)
- Prevents bugs (vs fixing in production)
- Faster onboarding (new devs get up to speed faster)
- Integration with existing workflow

"Most teams tell us they save 5-10 hours per developer per month. Over a year for a 10-person team, that's 600-1200 hours. What could your team do with that time?"

### "We need to see more data/case studies"

**Response:**
"Absolutely, let me share some relevant examples..."

*Provide:*
- Industry-specific case study
- Similar company size
- Concrete metrics (bug reduction, time saved)

*Follow up:*
"Would it help to speak with [similar company]? I can arrange a customer call."

### "We need to think about it"

**Response:**
"Of course, this is an important decision. To help you think it through, what specific areas do you need more information on?"

*Identify the real objection:*
- Budget approval process
- Technical concerns
- Stakeholder buy-in
- Competing priorities

*Address directly and create urgency:*
"I understand. One thing to consider - you mentioned [pain point costing $X]. Every month of delay is $X not saved. What if we set up a quick pilot to prove ROI?"

### "Can we get a free trial?"

**Response:**
"Absolutely! We offer a 14-day free trial with full feature access."

*But also qualify:*
"To make sure the trial is successful, let's plan it out:
- Which repositories will you analyze?
- What success metrics matter to you?
- Who on your team will participate?
- When can we check in on progress?"

*Set clear next steps:*
"Let's schedule a kickoff call on [date] to get you started, and a checkpoint on [date] to review results. Does that work?"

## Pricing & Negotiation

### Published Pricing (Hold Firm)

**Individual** - $29/month
**Professional** - $99/month
**Team** - $499/month
**Enterprise** - Custom

### Discount Guidelines

**Annual Prepay:**
- Offer: 2 months free (16% discount)
- Automatic, no approval needed

**Team (5+ seats):**
- Up to 10% volume discount
- Manager approval required

**Enterprise (20+ seats):**
- Custom pricing
- Volume discounts up to 25%
- Requires executive approval

### When to Discount

**DO offer discount for:**
- Annual commitment
- Large team size
- Case study participation
- Industry reference
- Multi-year contract

**DON'T discount for:**
- "Just because"
- First objection
- Without commitment
- Below 10% for Professional/Team

### Negotiation Tactics

**Anchoring:**
"Most teams of your size invest $1,500-2,000/month in code quality tools. Our Team plan at $499 is designed to be accessible while delivering enterprise-level value."

**Give to Get:**
"I can offer [discount/additional seats/longer trial] if you can [commit annually/close this month/provide case study]."

**Time-Limited:**
"We're running a promotion this quarter for annual subscriptions. I can lock in [offer] if we can move forward by [date]."

### Enterprise Contracts

**Negotiable:**
- Pricing (volume discounts)
- Payment terms (quarterly, annual)
- Contract length (multi-year)
- Custom features (within reason)
- On-premise deployment (premium)
- SLA guarantees (premium)

**Not Negotiable:**
- Core functionality
- Security standards
- Support SLAs (unless upgraded)
- Data retention policies

## Closing Techniques

### Trial Close
"If I could show you how to reduce production bugs by 30% in the next quarter, would that be valuable?"

"On a scale of 1-10, how excited are you about CodeAware?"
*If < 8: "What would make it a 10?"*

### Assumptive Close
"Should we get you started on the Team plan or does Enterprise make more sense?"

"Great! Let me send over the contract. What email should I use?"

### Urgency Close
"We have limited onboarding slots this month. If we get your contract signed by Friday, we can get you started next week. Otherwise, it might be 2-3 weeks. Does that timing work?"

### Alternatives Close
"I see two paths forward: Option A is the Team plan at $499/month starting next month. Option B is a 2-week pilot with 2 repositories, then Team plan if successful. Which makes more sense?"

### Direct Close
"Based on everything we've discussed, it sounds like CodeAware solves your key problems. Are you ready to move forward?"
