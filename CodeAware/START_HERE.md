**One More Thing...**

Remember: Every successful SaaS company started exactly where you are now - with an idea and a first version. 

Stripe's first version was clunky.
Slack started as a game company tool.
Instagram was a check-in app.

**Your job is to launch, learn, and iterate.**

The Dunning-Kruger effect in coding is a **real, expensive problem**. CodeAware is a **real, valuable solution**. 

Now go make it happen! 🚀
