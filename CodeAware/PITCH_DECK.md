# CodeAware Pitch Deck

## Slide 1: Title
**CodeAware**
*Know Your Code. Know Yourself.*

Automated Code Quality Assessment + Developer Awareness Metrics

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### Developers Don't Know What They Don't Know

**The Dunning-Kruger Effect in Coding:**

📊 **67%** of developers overestimate their code quality
🔒 **83%** of security breaches come from code vulnerabilities
💰 **$2.08 trillion** spent annually fixing bad code
⏱️ **23%** of developer time spent fixing bugs from poor code quality

**The Cycle:**
1. Developer lacks awareness of their skill gaps
2. Ships buggy, insecure, unmaintainable code
3. App breaks / Security breach / Can't scale
4. Business loses money, reputation, customers
