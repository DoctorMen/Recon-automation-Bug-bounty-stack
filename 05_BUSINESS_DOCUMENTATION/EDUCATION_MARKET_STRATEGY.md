It's a game engine that runs entirely in a web browser. No installation, no downloads, works on Chromebooks.

**Why schools love it:**
- Zero IT overhead (just share a URL)
- Works on any device instantly
- Students start building games in 5 minutes
- Curriculum-ready with lesson plans
- 10 AI coding assistants included

## 🎤 Demo Script for Schools

### Introduction (3 minutes)
"Thank you for your time. Before I show you the platform, I'd love to understand your current challenges with STEM education. What's working well, and where do you see opportunities for improvement?"

**Listen for:**
- Student engagement issues

---

### Product Demo (7 minutes)

**Part 1: Student Experience (3 min)**
"Let me show you what a student sees. [Open NEXUS ENGINE]

Notice how they can start building immediately. No installation, no setup. Just click and create.

[Show building a simple game]

This is what students do in their first 15 minutes. They're learning JavaScript, 3D math, physics—but it feels like playing."

**Part 2: Teacher Dashboard (2 min)**
"Now here's what you see as a teacher. [Show dashboard]

You can track every student's progress, see their projects, provide feedback, and identify who needs help—all in real-time."

**Part 3: Curriculum Integration (2 min)**
"And here's the curriculum. [Show lesson plans]

We've aligned everything with state standards. You get 36 weeks of lessons, assessments, and projects. Your teachers can start using this tomorrow."

---

### ROI Discussion (5 minutes)

**For the district:**
"Let's talk about the investment. For a district your size, this would be $[X] per year.

Here's the ROI:
- **Increased enrollment:** Districts see 3x more students in CS electives
- **Reduced IT costs:** No software to install or maintain
- **Teacher time saved:** Curriculum is ready-to-use
- **Grant eligible:** This qualifies for ESSER and Title IV funding

Based on [X] students, that's $[Y] per student per year—less than the cost of one textbook."

---

### Close (5 minutes)

**Pilot Option:**
"I'd recommend starting with a pilot. $5,000 for one semester, one school. You get:
- Full platform access
- Teacher training
- Curriculum materials
- Our support team

If it works, we scale district-wide. If not, you've only invested $5,000 to find out. Fair?"

**Full Deployment:**
"Or if you want to go district-wide immediately, we can have you up and running in 30 days. Which approach makes more sense for [District Name]?"
