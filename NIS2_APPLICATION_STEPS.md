My automation system delivers comprehensive vulnerability assessments in 2 hours - perfect for consulting workflows where German clients need fast NIS2 compliance validation.

Scope Clarity:
I focus on vulnerability assessment and technical gap analysis (Phase 1). For full exploitation testing, you may need additional specialists, but my assessments provide the foundation required for NIS2 compliance documentation.
