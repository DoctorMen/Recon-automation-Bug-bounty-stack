# 🔒 Privacy & OPSEC: Should You Use Your Real Name?

## ⚠️ RECOMMENDATION: NO - Use a Pseudonym Instead

### Why NOT Use Your Real Name:

1. **OPSEC (Operational Security)**
   - Links your real identity to bug bounty activities
   - If system leaks, your real name is exposed
   - Can be used for social engineering attacks

2. **Privacy Concerns**
   - Real name can be used to find you online
   - Links to your personal info, social media, etc.
   - No need to expose real identity

3. **Safety**
   - If someone copies/steals system, they know your real name
   - Could be used maliciously
   - Better to keep identity private

## 💡 What About Legal Protection?

### You Can Still Have Legal Protection:

1. **Copyright with Pseudonym:**
   - Pseudonyms can be copyrighted
   - Still legally protected
   - Just register under your handle

2. **If Needed Later:**
   - Can prove ownership through other means
   - Code itself is proof of ownership
   - Git history, timestamps, etc.

3. **Real Name Only If:**
   - You're selling as a business
   - You need official legal entity
   - You're comfortable with exposure
