# ============================================
# API HACKING METHODOLOGY (hackingapis.pdf)
# ============================================
# Using hackingapis.pdf techniques:
# 1. API Discovery
#    - Endpoint enumeration (/api/, /v1/, /v2/, /graphql)
#    - Swagger/OpenAPI detection
#    - GraphQL introspection
#    - REST API discovery
#
# 2. API Authentication Testing
#    - JWT token manipulation
#    - OAuth flow testing
#    - API key enumeration
#    - Session management
#    - Bearer token testing
#
# 3. API Authorization Testing
#    - IDOR in API endpoints
#    - Privilege escalation
#    - Role-based access control
#    - API permission bypass
#
# 4. API Input Validation
#    - Parameter manipulation
#    - Mass assignment
#    - Parameter pollution
#    - Injection in API parameters
#
# 5. API Business Logic
#    - Rate limiting bypass
#    - Batch operations
#    - Race conditions
#    - State manipulation
#
# 6. API Information Disclosure
#    - Error messages
#    - Debug endpoints
#    - Version disclosure
#    - Stack traces
