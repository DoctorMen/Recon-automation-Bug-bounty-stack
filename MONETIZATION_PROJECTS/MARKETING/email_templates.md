## Consulting Outreach Templates

### Template 1: Cold Outreach (Security Teams)

**Subject:** Automate your security scans - 10x faster execution

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is [specific observation about their security needs/recent news].

I've built self-improving AI systems that automate security reconnaissance - scanning 1000+ targets with the same effort it currently takes you to scan 10.

**Real results from similar companies:**
• 10-30x faster execution
• 75% false positive reduction  
• Continuous improvement over time

The system learns optimal strategies and gets better with every run. Think compound intelligence.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see if this could help [Company]?

I've included a 2-minute demo video: [link]

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - I only take 3 clients per quarter, so if this resonates, let's connect soon.
```

### Template 2: Cold Outreach (Bug Bounty Platforms)

**Subject:** Scale your platform 50x without hiring

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

Quick question: How are you handling reconnaissance for [X number] programs on [Platform]?

I've built an agentic orchestration system that:
• Processes 10,000+ targets automatically
• Self-improves with each scan (compound learning)
• Reduces infrastructure costs 60%

**For context:** A similar platform went from 1,000 → 10,000 programs without adding headcount.

Their words: "Paid for itself in 18 days."

15-minute demo? I'll show you the exact architecture.

**Subject:** Following up - [Company] + AI automation

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

Following up on my email from [date] about automating [Company]'s security workflows.

**Subject:** How self-improving AI works (explained simply)

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name],

You're on the waitlist, so I wanted to explain exactly what makes Agentic Security Scanner different.

**Traditional automation:** Same speed forever
**Self-improving automation:** Gets 30-50% faster over time

Here's how:
1. Scans target
2. Measures what worked
3. Learns optimal strategies
4. Next scan uses learned knowledge
5. Repeat = compound improvements

**Real data:**
• Run 1: 20 min
• Run 10: 16 min (20% faster)
• Run 100: 10 min (50% faster)

It's like hiring a junior engineer who becomes a senior engineer automatically.
