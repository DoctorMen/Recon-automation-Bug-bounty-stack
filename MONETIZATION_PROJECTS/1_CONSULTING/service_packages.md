- **Time wasted**: 80% on repetitive tasks
- **Scaling**: Hire more people ($$$)

### With Agentic Automation
- **One-time investment**: $50k-150k
- **Automated scanning**: 1000+ targets/day
- **Time saved**: 90% automation
- **Scaling**: Add more machines (cheap)

### Break-Even
- **$50k package**: Pays for itself in 2-3 months (vs 1 engineer)
- **$100k package**: Pays for itself in 3-4 months (vs 3 engineers)
- **$150k package**: Pays for itself in 4-6 months (vs full team)
