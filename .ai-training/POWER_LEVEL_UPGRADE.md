## 🎯 New Workflows Enabled

### Autonomous Scanning
```
User: "Monitor example.com daily and alert on criticals"
AI: [Sets up continuous monitoring]
    [Scans daily at 2 AM]
    [Alerts instantly on critical findings]
    [Learns optimal scan times]
    [Improves accuracy over time]
```

### Conversational Intelligence
```
User: "Scan example.com"
AI: [Completes scan]
User: "What did you find?"
AI: "Found 12 vulnerabilities - 2 critical XSS, 3 high SQLi, 7 medium"
User: "Show me those XSS issues"
AI: [Displays XSS details with PoC]
User: "Generate exploits for them"
AI: [Creates safe PoC code for both]
User: "Submit to HackerOne"
AI: [Auto-fills submission with all evidence]
```

### Predictive Assistance
```
AI: "Analyzing your scan patterns..."
AI: "I notice you scan example.com every Monday"
AI: "Shall I automate this? I can:"
    - Run scans Monday 9 AM
    - Filter to critical/high
    - Email you summary
    - Alert immediately on criticals
User: "Yes"
AI: [Sets up automated workflow]
```

## 🧠 Advanced AI Behaviors

### Self-Learning Examples
- Learns you prefer fast scans → defaults to speed mode
- Notices you always export critical findings → auto-suggests export
- Sees pattern of VPN issues → warns proactively
- Tracks what settings work best → applies automatically

### Context Chain Examples
```
Turn 1: "Scan the target" → AI: "Which target?"
Turn 2: "example.com" → AI: [scans, stores as @TARGET]
Turn 3: "Is it done?" → AI: [resolves "it" = @TARGET scan]
Turn 4: "Show results" → AI: [shows @TARGET findings]
Turn 5: "Just critical" → AI: [filters @TARGET to critical]
Turn 6: "Export those" → AI: [exports @TARGET critical findings]
```

### Error Prediction Examples
- Detects low disk space → prevents scan failure
- Notices unstable VPN → adjusts settings proactively  
- Predicts rate limiting → reduces request rate
- Identifies missing tools → auto-installs before running
