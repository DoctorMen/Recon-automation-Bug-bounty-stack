## ⚡ THE RULE

**ALWAYS prioritize: Quickest Path to First Dollar ROI**

**What This Means:**
- ✅ Focus on strategies that earn TODAY
- ✅ Use proven 90% win rate approach
- ✅ Skip anything that delays first dollar
- ✅ Add bonus income AFTER earning

## ✅ PROVEN PATH (DEFAULT)

**Strategy:** Upwork Freelancing (Emergency/Urgent Jobs)

**Why:**
- ✅ Earns TODAY (2-6 hours)
- ✅ 90% win rate (proven)
- ✅ $200-$500 first project
- ✅ Tools ready, no delays

**Status:** ✅ **MOST EFFICIENT - USE THIS**

## ❌ WHAT TO SKIP (Until After First Dollar)

**Skip:**
- ❌ Affiliate Marketing (bonus income, not primary)
- ❌ SaaS Deployment (do after first earnings)
- ❌ YouTube/Content (months to monetize)
- ❌ Any strategy that doesn't earn TODAY

**Why:**
- All delay first dollar
- All less efficient than current path
- All can be added AFTER earning
