```

### Revenue Potential

```
If You Match Their Volume (Conservative):
- They have 4028 reviews over ~2 years = ~168 orders/month
- Average order value: $500 (mix of tiers)
- Monthly revenue: $84,000
- Your automation = can do 3x volume = $252,000/month potential

Realistic Target (10% of their volume):
- 17 orders/month
- Average order value: $400 (your pricing)
- Monthly revenue: $6,800
- Time investment: 45-60 hours (vs 160 for them)

## CONCLUSION

### Key Takeaways

1. **They charge $250-$750** for 3-10 day pentests
2. **You can charge $97-$997** with 24hr-5day delivery (faster + broader range)
3. **Their secret:** Manual testing for higher tiers (you need to add this)
4. **Their advantage:** 4K reviews (you need to build social proof fast)
5. **Your advantage:** 5-10x faster, broader tech coverage, scalable automation

### Immediate Action Plan

✅ **Tonight:** Update report templates with compliance mapping  
✅ **This Week:** Add manual testing checklist for Advanced tier  
✅ **This Month:** Launch 4-tier pricing ($97/$197/$497/$997)  
✅ **Next 90 Days:** Get 20-30 reviews to build social proof  

### Revenue Target

**Conservative:** 10-15 orders/month @ $400 avg = $4,000-6,000/month  
**Realistic:** 20-30 orders/month @ $500 avg = $10,000-15,000/month  
**Aggressive:** 40-50 orders/month @ $600 avg = $24,000-30,000/month  

**Your automation gives you capacity for 50+ orders/month. They're doing ~168/month at $84K. You can hit $20K/month within 6 months by capturing 10% of their market with better speed and pricing.**
