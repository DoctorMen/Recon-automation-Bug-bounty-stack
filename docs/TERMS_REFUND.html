      <h1>Terms & Refund Policy</h1>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Scope</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Only assets explicitly listed and authorized via the Consent & Scope Form are tested.</li>
          <li>Only non‑intrusive, read‑only techniques are used (no exploitation, no data exfiltration).</li>
          <li>Rate limits and testing windows are honored as provided.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Deliverables</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Same‑day report: summary, severity, affected assets, reproduction steps and evidence bundle.</li>
          <li>Delivery via email to the contacts provided in the form.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Payment Terms</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Payment is due upfront via the checkout link (Stripe or equivalent). Prices exclude taxes unless stated.</li>
          <li>By paying, Customer agrees to these Terms and the Consent & Scope Form (collectively, the “Agreement”).</li>
          <li>Chargebacks: Customer agrees to first notify Provider of any dispute and allow 10 business days to cure prior to initiating a chargeback.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Refund Guarantee (Conditional)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>If Provider fails to deliver the report within Customer’s agreed same‑day (or 4‑hour Express) window after receipt of payment and a completed Consent & Scope Form, Provider will refund 100% of the fee.</li>
          <li>No refund is due where delay is caused by: missing/incorrect scope or contacts, change to scope after payment, unavailable assets, Customer‑requested reschedule, environmental rate‑limits beyond Provider control, or third‑party block of allowlisting.</li>
          <li>Refunds are processed to the original payment method within 5–10 business days after confirmation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Authorization & Safe Harbor</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Customer represents it has full authority over the assets in Exhibit A (the Consent & Scope Form) and authorizes non‑intrusive, read‑only testing during the specified windows and rate limits.</li>
          <li>Activities are intended to fall within applicable security testing “safe harbor” allowances and are strictly limited to the authorized assets and windows.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Prohibited Activities</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>No exploitation, privilege escalation, authentication bypass, data exfiltration, or denial‑of‑service/stress testing.</li>
          <li>Provider will immediately cease testing upon any sign of instability and will notify Customer without undue delay.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Customer Responsibilities</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide accurate scope, testing windows, and rate limits; ensure all third parties (e.g., CDN/WAF/hosting) are notified and any allowlisting is complete.</li>
          <li>Ensure internal authorization for all assets listed; Customer indemnifies Provider for claims arising from lack of authority or inaccurate scope.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Provider’s aggregate liability arising out of or related to this Agreement shall not exceed the fees paid by Customer in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim.</li>
          <li>In no event shall either party be liable for any consequential, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive, or indirect damages.</li>
          <li>Services are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind beyond those expressly stated.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Indemnification</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Each party will defend and indemnify the other against third‑party claims to the extent caused by its gross negligence or willful misconduct.</li>
          <li>Customer will defend and indemnify Provider against claims arising from Customer’s lack of authority over assets in scope or violations of applicable law by Customer.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Incident Handling</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>On suspected instability or impact, Provider will stop testing and notify Customer promptly; the parties will cooperate in good faith to resolve.</li>
          <li>Neither party will make admissions of fault to third parties regarding the incident without the other’s prior written consent.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Confidentiality & Data Handling</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Both parties will keep confidential information secret and use it only to perform under this Agreement.</li>
          <li>Provider minimizes data collection and prefers headers/metadata/screenshots; evidence is retained for up to 90 days unless a longer period is required by law or agreed in writing, after which it is securely deleted.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Intellectual Property & License</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Provider’s methods, templates, scripts, playbooks and know‑how are proprietary and not transferred. All right, title and interest in such materials remain with Provider.</li>
          <li>Deliverables (reports and evidence) are licensed to Customer on a non‑exclusive, non‑transferable basis for Customer’s internal security and compliance purposes only.</li>
          <li>Customer may share Deliverables internally and with auditors/regulators under NDA. Public disclosure requires Provider’s written consent.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Restrictions (No Reverse Engineering)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Customer will not attempt to decompile, reverse engineer, reproduce, or derive Provider’s methods, templates, or automation from the Deliverables, and will not use the Services to build a competing offering.</li>
          <li>No redistribution, resale, or sublicensing of Deliverables or Services.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Governing law and venue: specify state/country and courts or binding arbitration seat as applicable.</li>
          <li>Good‑faith negotiation → optional mediation → arbitration/courts. Prevailing party may recover reasonable fees where permitted by law.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-size:12px;color:#aab3c5">This template is provided for convenience only and does not constitute legal advice. Have counsel review and localize governing law/venue and any regulatory requirements.</p>
        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Form responses are used solely to conduct the engagement.</li>
          <li>We email a PDF receipt of your consent and scope to both parties for audit purposes.</li>
          <li>Evidence may include publicly accessible metadata (e.g., headers, certificates, screenshots).</li>
