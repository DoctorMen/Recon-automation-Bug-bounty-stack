## **FAQs (Add to listing)**

**Q: What makes you different from other pentesters?**  
A: We combine automation (for speed) with manual testing (for depth). This gives you comprehensive results in 60 hours vs the industry standard 5–10 days, at 25% lower cost.

**Q: Do I need to provide test credentials?**  
A: For authenticated testing (Standard/Advanced), yes. We'll request test accounts via the scope form. We test in isolated environments and never touch production data.

**Q: Is this safe for my production site?**  
A: Yes. We perform non-destructive testing only. We validate vulnerabilities with proof-of-concept but don't exploit them fully. No data loss or corruption.

**Q: What if you find nothing?**  
A: Great! That means your security posture is strong. We'll still deliver a report confirming our testing scope and methodology, which you can use for compliance.

**Q: Can I get a re-test after fixing issues?**  
A: Yes. Included free in Advanced tier (within 30 days). For Starter/Standard, re-tests are 50% off the original price.

**Q: What compliance frameworks do you cover?**  
A: Our methodology aligns with OWASP, NIST, PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2, and ISO 27001. We provide mapping in the report for audit purposes.

**Q: Do you offer ongoing/retainer services?**  
A: Yes! After your first assessment, we offer monthly retainers (4 tests/month) at discounted rates. Message me for details.

**Q: What if I need faster delivery?**  
A: Advanced tier includes 48-hour delivery. For ultra-urgent cases (24h), message me and we can discuss priority pricing.
