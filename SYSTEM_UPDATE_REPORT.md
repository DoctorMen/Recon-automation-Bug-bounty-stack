### **2. Vibe Coding Best Practices** (From Second Video)

**What It Is:**
- The "right way" to work with AI to write code
- Like pair programming with a senior engineer

**What Changed:**

- Clear, understandable, maintainable

**File Added:**
- `VIBE_CODING_BEST_PRACTICES.md` - How we code professionally

**Example of What This Means:**

**Wrong Way:**
```
You: "Make a mindmap"
AI: *Creates something*
You: "It's broken"
AI: *Random fixes*
Result: Still broken, wasted time
```

**Right Way (What We Do Now):**
```
You: "Create 3D mindmap with Google Maps controls"
AI: *Analyzes what's needed*
    *Implements proper physics*
    *Tests it works*
    *Documents how it works*
Result: Professional, stable, works perfectly ✅
