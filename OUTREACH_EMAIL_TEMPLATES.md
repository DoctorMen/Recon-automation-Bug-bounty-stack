## TEMPLATE 1: VP OF PRODUCT (COLD OUTREACH)

**Subject:** 3D Visualization for [Company] - Live Demo

```
Hi [First Name],

I built a 3D interactive visualization engine that could transform how [Company] users visualize [their specific feature - projects/knowledge/data].

Live Demo: [your-demo-link]

Key advantages:
• 10x more engaging than 2D diagrams
• 60 FPS performance (tested on 10K+ nodes)
• 2-week integration time
• Web-native (works everywhere)

[Competitor] doesn't have this. You could be first.

Would you be open to a 15-minute demo this week?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - We're offering exclusive licensing to only 5 companies. [Company] would be perfect as #1.
```

## TEMPLATE 2: CTO (TECHNICAL ANGLE)

**Subject:** 3D Rendering Engine - Technical Demo for [Company]

```
Hi [First Name],

I've developed a Three.js-based 3D visualization engine with some impressive specs:

Technical Highlights:
• 60 FPS with 10,000+ nodes
• <2s load time
• Real-time physics simulation
• WebGL-accelerated rendering
• Mobile + desktop compatible

Live Demo: [your-demo-link]
GitHub: [if you have public samples]

This could enhance [Company]'s [specific feature] with minimal engineering lift (2-week integration).

Open to a technical deep-dive this week?

Best,
[Your Name]

Tech Stack: Three.js, WebGL, Force-directed graphs, Custom physics engine
```

## TEMPLATE 3: HEAD OF INNOVATION (STRATEGIC)

**Subject:** Category-Defining 3D Visualization Technology

```
Hi [First Name],

Quick question: Why is everyone still using 2D diagrams in 2025?

I built something different - a 3D interactive visualization engine that makes data exploration actually engaging.

What makes it unique:
• First true 3D engine for B2B SaaS
• 10x user engagement vs 2D
• Patent-pending technology
• Zero competitors (yet)

Live Demo: [your-demo-link]

[Company] could own this category. Interested in seeing how?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - Mapbox did this for maps ($280M ARR). We're doing it for data visualization.
```

## TEMPLATE 4: PRODUCT MANAGER (USE CASE FOCUSED)

**Subject:** 3D [Project Management/Knowledge Graph] for [Company]

```
Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company] uses 2D diagrams for [specific feature]. 

What if users could explore their [projects/knowledge/data] in 3D space instead?

Demo (30 seconds): [your-demo-link]

Real customer feedback:
"This is 10x better than any diagram tool I've used"
"Finally makes complex relationships actually understandable"
"Feels like the future"

Integration: 2 weeks
Cost: Less than hiring 1 engineer for 6 months

Quick call this week to show you?

Best,
[Your Name]
```
