    "description": "\nA clickjacking vulnerability has been discovered on gitlab.com that allows malicious websites to embed GitLab in invisible iframes, potentially enabling UI redress attacks against users.\n\nThe vulnerability exists because gitlab.com lacks proper clickjacking protection mechanisms such as X-Frame-Options header or Content-Security-Policy frame-ancestors directive.\n\nThis allows attackers to create convincing phishing scenarios where users believe they're interacting with the legitimate GitLab interface when they're actually performing actions on an attacker-controlled overlay.\n            ",
