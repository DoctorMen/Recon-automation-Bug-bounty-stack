Title: [Resource] My Complete Bug Bounty Automation System

Body:

I've spent the last [X months/years] building a complete automation 
system for bug bounty hunting, and I'm releasing it today.

THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES:

Manual reconnaissance is slow. You spend hours running the same commands
over and over. By the time you finish recon, someone else found the bug.

MY SOLUTION:

Complete automation with a natural language interface.

Instead of: python3 run_recon.py --target example.com --output ./results

You type: "scan example.com"

That's it.

WHAT'S INCLUDED:

• Full reconnaissance automation
• Vulnerability scanning integration
• Natural language command system ("vibe coding")
• Report generation
• All my scripts and configs

RESULTS I'VE GOTTEN:

[Your actual bug bounty stats if you have them, or general improvements]

PRICE:

Normally $497. Launch special: $97.

I'm not trying to get rich off this. I just want to help the community
and recoup some development costs.
