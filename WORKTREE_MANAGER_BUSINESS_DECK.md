## SLIDE 1: TITLE

# WorktreeManager™

**Never Manually Open 15 Worktrees Again**

*The first visual Git worktree management system*

---

## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

### Every Developer Faces This:

![Problem Screenshot]

**"The 'repository' has 15 worktrees which won't be opened automatically."**

### The Pain:
- ⏰ **5 minutes wasted** opening worktrees manually
- 😤 **Context switching hell** - lose flow state
- 🔍 **No overview** - can't see all worktrees at once
- 🐌 **Tedious operations** - git pull × 15, git push × 15

**This happens EVERY DAY to 10 million developers.**

---

## SLIDE 3: THE COST

### Time Wasted Per Developer:

```
5 minutes/day × 250 workdays = 1,250 minutes/year
= 20.8 hours/year
= 2.6 workdays/year

At $100/hour = $2,080 wasted per developer per year
```

### For a Team of 10:
```
$2,080 × 10 = $20,800/year wasted
```

### For Enterprise (100 developers):
```
$2,080 × 100 = $208,000/year wasted
```

**This is a $2 BILLION problem across the industry.**

---

## SLIDE 4: THE SOLUTION
