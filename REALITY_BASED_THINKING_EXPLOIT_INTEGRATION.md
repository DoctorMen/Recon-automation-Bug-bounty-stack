## 🛡️ SAFETY INTEGRATION

### **How Safety is Enforced:**

**1. Authorization Layer (Integrated with Safety Check System)**
- Every exploit activity requires written authorization
- Explicit exploit verification permission required
- Automatic blocking if authorization missing
- Audit trail of all authorization checks

**2. Technical Safety Constraints (Hard-Coded)**
```python
SAFETY_LIMITS = {
    "proof_of_concept_only": True,         # NEVER full exploitation
    "no_weaponization": True,               # NEVER create exploit tools
    "no_data_access": True,                 # NEVER access real data
    "no_production_testing": False,         # Production blocked by default
    "max_requests_per_test": 10,            # Prevent DoS
    "max_test_duration_seconds": 300,       # 5-minute timeout
    "isolated_environment_preferred": True, # Use test environments
    "auto_rollback": True                   # Immediate restoration
}
```

**3. Ethical Framework (The "HARM NONE" Methodology)**
- **H** - Honor Authorization
- **A** - Avoid Production Systems
- **R** - Respect Boundaries
- **M** - Minimize Impact
- **N** - Never Exceed Scope
- **O** - Observe Professional Standards
- **N** - No Malicious Intent
- **E** - Educate and Improve

**4. Emergency Stop System**
```bash
# Immediate halt of all exploit activities
python3 scripts/emergency_stop.py --stop-all --reason "Description"
```
