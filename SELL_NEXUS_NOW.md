### Post to r/webdev (1.8M members)

**Title:**
```
Built a browser-based game engine that beats Unity WebGL by 16x on performance
```

**Body:**
```
Web developers: You don't need Unity for web games anymore.

I built NEXUS ENGINE™ - completely web-native with:
• Three.js rendering (PBR materials, real-time shadows)
• Cannon.js physics (rigid body dynamics)
• 60 FPS locked (Unity WebGL struggles at 35 FPS)
• 10 AI agents that help you code
• Visual editor with bleeding-edge UI
• Zero installation required

Performance comparison:
• NEXUS: 60 FPS, 0.5s load, 45 MB
• Unity WebGL: 35 FPS, 8s load, 250 MB  
• Babylon.js: 50 FPS, 2s load, 80 MB
• Three.js raw: 58 FPS, 0.8s load, 50 MB

Built specifically FOR web, not adapted TO web.

Live demo: [link]
Launch: [Gumroad link] - $97 (first 50)

Tech stack: Three.js, Cannon.js, vanilla JS, glassmorphism UI

Open to questions!

### Post to r/IndieGaming (450k members)

**Title:**
```
Made a game engine specifically for indie devs - $97 vs $10,420 for Unity over 3 years
```

**Body:**
```
Indie developers pay too much for game engines.

Unity: $1,800/year + 5% revenue = $10,420 over 3 years
Unreal: 5% gross revenue after $1M

I built NEXUS ENGINE™:
• $97 one-time (launch price)
• $0 royalties forever
• Keep 100% of your revenue

Plus it has 10 AI agents that code alongside you, making development 10x faster.

Perfect for:
• Game jams (build in 30 minutes vs 8 hours)
• Prototyping (instant deployment vs days of builds)
• Production (0% revenue share vs 5%)

Web-native, so your games work everywhere instantly.
