- **After Delivery:** "Want monthly monitoring? $500/month"
- **After Fix:** "Want quarterly assessments? $800/quarter"
- **After Positive Review:** "Want to continue? $500/month"

### **Strategy 4: Scarcity**
- "I only take 5 new clients per week"
- "Limited availability this month"
- Creates urgency

### **Strategy 5: Social Proof**
- "500+ businesses scanned"
- "95% client satisfaction"
- "2,000+ vulnerabilities found"

### **Strategy 6: Value Stacking**
- Base scan: $200
- Add manual testing: +$100
- Add compliance mapping: +$200
- Add monthly monitoring: +$500/month

## 10. API SECURITY SPECIALIZATION (from hackingapis.pdf)

### **Key API Vulnerabilities to Test:**

#### **1. Authentication Vulnerabilities**
- Weak JWT implementation
- OAuth flow flaws
- API key exposure
- Session fixation
- Token reuse

#### **2. Authorization Vulnerabilities**
- IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References)
- Privilege escalation
- RBAC bypass
- Horizontal vs vertical access control

#### **3. Input Validation**
- SQL injection
- NoSQL injection
- XXE (XML External Entity)
- SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)
- Command injection

#### **4. Business Logic**
- Race conditions
- Parameter tampering
- Workflow bypass
- Price manipulation
- Quantity manipulation

#### **5. Rate Limiting**
- Brute force attacks
- DDoS vulnerabilities
- Resource exhaustion
- Bypass techniques

### **API Testing Methodology:**
1. **Discovery:** Find all endpoints (60+ auto-discovered)
2. **Authentication Testing:** Test auth mechanisms
3. **Authorization Testing:** Test access controls
4. **Input Validation:** Test all inputs
5. **Business Logic:** Test application logic
6. **Rate Limiting:** Test protections
7. **Report Generation:** Create PoC requests
