3. Open Upwork and log in
```

### **EXECUTION** (15 minutes)

   1. Read job → Match to proposal number
   2. Copy proposal from INSTANT_SUBMIT_PROPOSALS.md
   3. Paste into Upwork

## ⚠️ SAFETY GUIDELINES

### ✅ SAFE (Do this):
- Manually submit each application
- Read each job before applying
- Customize client name in proposals
- Track your applications
- Respond to interviews within 1 hour

### ❌ UNSAFE (Don't do this):
- **Don't use automation bots** (Upwork will ban you)
- **Don't copy-paste without customizing** (looks generic)
- **Don't apply to jobs you can't deliver** (damages reputation)
- **Don't submit and forget** (check messages regularly)
