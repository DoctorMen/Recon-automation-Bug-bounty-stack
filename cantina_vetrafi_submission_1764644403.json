This allows attackers to embed the banking interface in malicious iframes and trick service members into authorizing unauthorized financial transactions through UI manipulation. The vulnerability affects the main banking application where users approve transactions, connect wallets, and manage accounts - posing significant financial risk to military personnel who trust VetraFi with their funds.",
