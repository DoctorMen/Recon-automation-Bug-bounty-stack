Title: Potential Security Issue in Apple CDN Endpoint - Scope Verification Requested

IMPORTANT DISCLOSURE:
This endpoint appears to be a CDN subdomain (hash prefix: 2b4a6b31ca2273bb).
Please verify if CDN endpoints are within the scope of the Apple Security Bounty program.
If this is out of scope, please let me know and I will not pursue further testing.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

Endpoint: http://2b4a6b31ca2273bb.apple.com/api/checkout

During automated security testing, I discovered this endpoint that responds with:
- HTTP Status: 301 (Moved Permanently)
- Server Header: Apple
- Redirect Location: https://d425438857f7719a.apple.com/api/checkout

BEHAVIOR OBSERVED:
The endpoint responds with a 301 redirect to HTTPS. The hash prefix in the subdomain 
(2b4a6b31ca2273bb) suggests this is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) endpoint, which 
may be out of scope for the bug bounty program.

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
If this is an Apple-owned web server, proper authentication and authorization should 
be in place. However, since this appears to be a CDN endpoint, I wanted to verify 
scope before conducting further testing.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
1. Send GET request to: http://2b4a6b31ca2273bb.apple.com/api/checkout
2. Observe response headers and status code
3. Follow redirect if applicable

HTTP Request:
GET /api/checkout HTTP/1.1
Host: 2b4a6b31ca2273bb.apple.com

HTTP Response:
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Server: Apple
Location: https://d425438857f7719a.apple.com/api/checkout
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 162

Response Body:
<html>
<head><title>301 Moved Permanently</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>301 Moved Permanently</h1></center>
<hr><center>Apple</center>
</body>
</html>

IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
Since this appears to be a CDN endpoint, the security impact may be limited.
However, if this endpoint is in scope and contains vulnerabilities, it could 
potentially affect users accessing Apple services through the CDN.

SCOPE VERIFICATION REQUEST:
Please confirm:
1. Is this CDN endpoint in scope?
2. Should I conduct further security testing?
3. Are there specific testing guidelines for CDN endpoints?

Thank you for your time and consideration.
