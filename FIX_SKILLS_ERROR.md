# 🔧 Fix Skills Error - Proper Format

**Why the Error Persists & How to Fix**

---

## 🔍 THE PROBLEM

**You Have:**
- "Security Assesment" (typo - missing 's')
- "VulnerabilityScan" (no space)
- Skills may not be recognized by Upwork

**Upwork Requires:**
- Exact skill names from their database
- Properly formatted (spaces, spelling)
- Added as individual tags (not comma-separated)

---

## ✅ SOLUTION: Clear & Re-Add Skills Properly

### **Step 1: Clear Current Skills**

**Click the X icon on each skill tag to remove them all**

---

### **Step 2: Add Skills One by One**

**Click in the "Skills and deliverables" field**

**Type each skill separately and wait for Upwork autocomplete:**

1. **Type:** `Security` 
   - Wait for dropdown
   - Select: **"Security Testing"** or **"Security Assessment"**

2. **Type:** `Vulnerability`
   - Wait for dropdown
   - Select: **"Vulnerability Assessment"**

3. **Type:** `Penetration`
   - Wait for dropdown
   - Select: **"Penetration Testing"**

4. **Type:** `Web Security`
   - Wait for dropdown
   - Select: **"Web Security"**

5. **Type:** `Security Audit`
   - Wait for dropdown
   - Select: **"Security Auditing"** or **"Security Audit"**

**Important:** Use Upwork's autocomplete suggestions - don't type freeform!

---

## 💡 WHY THIS HAPPENS

**Upwork Skills System:**
- Requires skills from their database
- Freeform text may not work
- Autocomplete ensures correct format
- Exact spelling/spacing matters

**Your Current Issue:**
- "Security Assesment" = typo (not in database)
- "VulnerabilityScan" = no space (not recognized)
- Need exact matches from Upwork's skill list

---

## ✅ PROPER METHOD

**Don't Type Comma-Separated:**
- ❌ "Security Assessment, Vulnerability Scan" (may not work)

**Do Type One at a Time:**
- ✅ Type "Security" → Select from dropdown
- ✅ Type "Vulnerability" → Select from dropdown
- ✅ Type "Penetration" → Select from dropdown
- ✅ Repeat for each skill

---

## 🎯 EXACT SKILLS TO ADD

**Use These Exact Names (from Upwork's database):**

1. **Security Testing**
2. **Vulnerability Assessment**
3. **Penetration Testing**
4. **Web Security**
5. **Security Auditing**

**Method:**
- Clear all current skills (click X on each)
- Type each skill name
- Select from Upwork's autocomplete dropdown
- Press Enter or click to add

## 🔍 IF AUTCOMPLETE DOESN'T SHOW

**For Security:**
- "Security Testing"
- "Information Security"
- "Cybersecurity"

**For Vulnerability:**
- "Vulnerability Assessment"
