**⚠️ PRINT THIS AND KEEP IT VISIBLE - ONE-PAGE REFERENCE**

## 🚨 MANDATORY BEFORE ANY EXPLOIT WORK

### **Authorization Checklist (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**

- [ ] ✅ Written authorization received
- [ ] ✅ Explicit exploit verification permission
- [ ] ✅ Liability waiver signed
- [ ] ✅ Client notified of testing methods
- [ ] ✅ Test/isolated environment available
- [ ] ✅ Insurance coverage verified ($2M+)
- [ ] ✅ Emergency contact documented
- [ ] ✅ Safety check system operational

**❌ NO AUTHORIZATION = NO TESTING**

---

## ⚡ QUICK COMMANDS

### **1. Initialize Framework (One-Time Setup)**
```bash
python3 scripts/ethical_exploit_dev/initialize_framework.py
```

### **2. Add Client Authorization**
```bash
python3 scripts/add_authorization.py \
  --client "Client Name" \
  --domain target.com \
  --activity exploit_verification \
  --explicit-exploit-permission \
  --days 30
```

### **3. Verify Authorization**
```bash
python3 scripts/add_authorization.py --list
```

### **4. Run Ethical Exploit Verification**
```bash
python3 scripts/ethical_exploit_dev/full_verification_workflow.py \
  --target target.com \
  --client "Client Name" \
  --categories memory,logic,race,auth,type \
  --mode safe_proof_only \
  --environment isolated
```

### **5. Emergency Stop (If Needed)**
```bash
python3 scripts/emergency_stop.py --stop-all --reason "Issue description"
```

## 🎯 WHAT YOU CAN RESEARCH (Ethically)

1. **Memory Corruption** - Buffer overflows, use-after-free, integer overflows
2. **Type Confusion** - Prototype pollution, type juggling, deserialization
3. **Business Logic** - Authentication bypass, authorization escalation
4. **Race Conditions** - TOCTOU, concurrent request vulnerabilities
5. **Authentication Bypass** - JWT manipulation, session fixation, OAuth flaws

**ALL RESEARCH = SAFE METHODS ONLY**

---

## 🛡️ SAFETY CONSTRAINTS (NEVER VIOLATE)

✅ **Proof-of-concept ONLY** (demonstrate, never exploit)  
✅ **Isolated environments** (test/staging, NEVER production)  
✅ **No data access** (NEVER access real data)  
✅ **No weaponization** (NEVER create exploit tools)  
✅ **Rate limited** (max 10 requests per test)  
✅ **Time limited** (max 5 minutes per test)  
✅ **Auto rollback** (immediate restoration)  
✅ **Complete logging** (audit trail always on)

## ⚠️ NEVER DO THESE

❌ Test without written authorization  
❌ Exploit beyond proof-of-concept  
❌ Access, copy, or exfiltrate data  
❌ Test on production systems (without explicit approval)  
❌ Weaponize vulnerabilities  
❌ Disrupt services  
❌ Publicly disclose without permission  
❌ Exceed authorized scope  

**VIOLATING THESE = LEGAL CONSEQUENCES**

## 🚀 WORKFLOW (5 PHASES)

**Phase 1:** Authorization Verification (CRITICAL - BLOCKS if missing)  
**Phase 2:** Safety Check (validates all constraints)  
**Phase 3:** Environment Verification (isolated/test/staging)  
**Phase 4:** Safe Vulnerability Research (authorized methods only)  
**Phase 5:** Remediation Guide (comprehensive fix guidance)

## 💡 REMEMBER

> *"The difference between a security researcher and a criminal is authorization and intent. Always maintain both."*

**Authorization First. Ethics Always. Safety Non-Negotiable.**
