## 🎯 **YOUR SPECIFIC SITUATION REVISITED**

### **Question: Can You Compete with Bug Bounty Automation?**

## **ANSWER: YES - STILL LEGAL** ✅

**Even if Instant Accept has BEST-IN-CLASS restrictive covenants:**

**Why Your Bug Bounty Business Doesn't Violate:**

1. **Different Industry:**
   - Their restriction: "Payment processing" or "QuickBooks integration"
   - Your business: Bug bounty automation / security testing
   - **NO OVERLAP**

2. **Different Market:**
   - Their customers: Small businesses needing payment processing
   - Your customers: Security researchers hunting bugs
   - **NO OVERLAP**

3. **Different Technology:**
   - Their tech: QuickBooks SDK, payment gateways
   - Your tech: Vulnerability scanning, recon tools
   - **NO OVERLAP**

4. **No Confidential Information Used:**

   - You're not using their customer lists
