# Phone Outreach Script

## Opening Script

```
"Hi, is this [Business Owner]? Great! This is [Your Name], I'm a security researcher here in [City].

I was looking at business websites in the area and I noticed [Their Website]. I actually found what looks like a security vulnerability that I wanted to alert you to.

Do you have 2 minutes?"
```

## Hook (After They Say Yes)

```
"So I don't want to share details over the phone for security reasons, but it involves [customer data/payment processing/login system].

I can run a complete emergency security scan right now - takes me about 15 minutes to run, and I'll have a detailed report to you within 2 hours showing exactly what's vulnerable and how to fix it.

I charge $200 for the emergency scan. I can take PayPal, Venmo, or Zelle right now and get started immediately.

Sound good?"
```

## Handling "What did you find?"

```
"I'd rather not say specifics over the phone - don't want anyone else to hear. But it's a [HIGH/MEDIUM] severity issue that could let hackers [access customer data/take your site down/steal payment info].

The scan will show you exactly what it is and how serious. Want me to get started?"
```

## Closing (After They Agree)

```
"Perfect! My PayPal is paypal.me/[yourname]. Can you send the $200 right now while we're on the phone? Then I'll start immediately."

[Wait for confirmation]

"Great, got it! Starting your scan now. What's the best email to send the report to?"

[Get email]

"You'll have results by [TIME - 2 hours from now]. If you have any questions after reading it, just reply to my email or call me back.

Thanks for taking security seriously!"
```

## Common Objections

### "What did you find?"
- "I don't want to share details over the phone - security risk. But I can tell you it's [HIGH/MEDIUM] severity and involves [customer data/payments/login system]. The scan will show you exactly what it is and how to fix it. Want me to start now?"

### "Can you just tell me for free?"
- "I could, but a proper security scan checks for 100+ different vulnerabilities. What I found was just one thing I noticed. The $200 scan is comprehensive - you'll know everything that's vulnerable, not just this one issue. Plus I include fix instructions, so you or your developer can actually fix it. Sound good?"

### "I need to check with my [partner/IT person/boss]"
- "Totally understand. How about this: I'll run the scan in the next hour and email you the results. You can share with [person] and if they think it's valuable, just send the $200 via PayPal. If not, no charge. Fair?"

### "$200 is too much"
- "I hear you. What's your budget?" [They say $100 or $50] "Tell you what - I normally charge $500 for this. I'm offering $200 as an introductory rate. But I can do $150 if we can get started right now. Does that work?"

## Monthly Service Upsell Script

```
"Hi [Name], did you get my security report?"

[Let them react - usually worried]

"Yeah, [the critical issue] is serious. Want me to walk you through the fix real quick?"

[Spend 2-3 mins explaining]

"So here's what I recommend: I offer monthly security monitoring for $500/month. I scan your site every month and catch these issues before hackers do. Your competitors are probably doing this already.

Want to try it for a month? If you don't like it, just cancel."

[Handle objections]

If YES:
"Perfect! I'll send you a quick agreement and set up auto-billing through PayPal. Your first official monthly scan will be on [date 30 days from now]."
```
