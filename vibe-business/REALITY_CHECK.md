## 📊 Metrics Deep Dive

### The "340% MoM Growth" Claim

**How this number was generated**:
```
Month 1: 10 test runs on localhost
Month 2: 34 test runs on localhost
Month 3: 115 test runs (testing the script)

= 340% month-over-month growth! 🎉
```

**What this actually means**: The founder ran more tests while debugging

### The "847K+ Vulnerabilities Found" Claim

**How this number was generated**:
```
Ran Nuclei scanner on localhost
Got 847,328 findings (mostly info-level)
Multiplied by number of potential customers (0)
Claimed in pitch deck anyway
```

**What this actually means**: Scanner found stuff when testing, no production usage

### The "$2.3M Saved Per Customer" Claim

**How this number was calculated**:
```
Assumption: 20 security engineers × $180K salary = $3.6M
"We replace 13 of them" = $2.34M saved
Math checks out!* 

*Note: No actual customers, so $0 actually saved
```
