# What Actually Gets Paid in Bug Bounties

## Critical Reality Check

### What We Found (May NOT Get Paid):
- Endpoints returning 200 OK - This is NOT automatically a vulnerability
- Just discovering an endpoint doesn't mean it's exploitable

### What ACTUALLY Gets Paid:

1. **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)**
   - âœ… Must access OTHER users' data
   - âœ… Must show unauthorized access
   - âŒ Just accessing /payments/1 doesn't prove IDOR
   - âœ… Need: Access Account A's payment ID from Account B

2. **Authentication Bypass**
   - âœ… Must access PROTECTED resources without auth
   - âœ… Must show unauthorized access to sensitive data
   - âŒ Just 200 OK doesn't prove auth bypass
   - âœ… Need: Access admin functions without admin account

3. **Payment Manipulation**
   - âœ… Must actually manipulate payment amounts/statuses
   - âœ… Must show financial impact
   - âŒ Just POST requests accepted doesn't prove vulnerability
   - âœ… Need: Change payment amount from  to .01

4. **Sensitive Data Exposure**
   - âœ… Must expose actual sensitive data (PII, tokens, etc.)
   - âœ… Must show real data leakage
   - âŒ Just finding an endpoint doesn't prove exposure
   - âœ… Need: See credit cards, SSNs, API keys in response

## What We Need to Do:

1. Actually EXPLOIT the vulnerabilities
2. Show REAL impact
3. Provide PROOF of unauthorized access
4. Verify these are IN-SCOPE for Bugcrowd

## Next Steps:

- Test IDOR by accessing other users' data
- Test auth bypass by accessing protected functions
- Test payment manipulation with actual transactions
- Verify sensitive data exposure with real data
