TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

COMMON ISSUES:
-------------

1. "Command not found: subfinder/httpx/nuclei"
   Solution: Add ~/go/bin to PATH
   export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin

2. "Permission denied"
   Solution: Make scripts executable
   chmod +x *.sh
   chmod +x scripts/*.sh

3. "Module not found"
   Solution: Install Python dependencies
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt

4. "No results found"
   Solution: Check internet connection and target accessibility

5. "Nuclei templates not found"
   Solution: Update nuclei templates
   nuclei -update-templates


PERFORMANCE ISSUES:
------------------

Slow scans:
- Reduce concurrency in config
- Use --tier basic for faster scans
- Check network speed

High memory usage:
- Scan fewer targets at once
- Use --quiet mode
- Close other applications


INSTALLATION ISSUES:
-------------------

Go tools not installing:
1. Verify Go is installed: go version
2. Check GOPATH: echo $GOPATH
3. Manually install tools (see INSTALLATION.txt)

Python errors:
1. Verify Python 3.8+: python3 --version
2. Use virtual environment
3. Install dependencies one by one


SCANNING ISSUES:
---------------

No subdomains found:
- Target may not have subdomains
- DNS resolution issues
- Try different DNS servers

No vulnerabilities found:
- Good! Target may be secure
- Try advanced tier
- Update nuclei templates

Scan hangs:
- Check target is accessible
- Reduce timeout values
- Use Ctrl+C to cancel


GETTING HELP:
------------

1. Check documentation files
2. Review error messages carefully
3. Search error messages online
4. Verify all requirements installed
5. Test with known-good target


LEGAL ISSUES:
------------

⚠️ IMPORTANT:
- Only scan authorized targets
- Get written permission
- Follow responsible disclosure
- Respect scope limitations
- Stop if asked by target owner

For legal questions, consult an attorney.
