# ⚖️ Upwork Account Privacy & Anonymity

## 🚨 CRITICAL: You Cannot Make a Verified Account Anonymous

### Why Upwork Requires Identity Verification

Upwork's Terms of Service **REQUIRE**:
- ✅ Real identity verification
- ✅ Valid government ID
- ✅ Tax information (for payments)
- ✅ Accurate profile information
- ✅ Verifiable payment methods

**You CANNOT**:
- ❌ Create anonymous accounts
- ❌ Use fake identities
- ❌ Hide your verified identity
- ❌ Operate under pseudonyms for payments
- ❌ Bypass identity verification

---

## 📋 What Privacy Options ARE Available (Legal)

### 1. **Profile Display Name**
You can use a professional name or business name on your public profile while keeping legal name for payments.

```
Legal Name (Required for payments): John Smith
Display Name (Public): JS Creative Solutions
```

**How to do this**:
1. Go to Settings → Profile Settings
2. Edit "Display Name" field
3. Keep legal name for tax/payment purposes
4. Use business/professional name publicly

### 2. **Limited Profile Visibility**

**Available Options**:
- Make profile visible only to clients you apply to
- Hide earnings from public view
- Hide hourly rate (for hourly contracts)
- Control what portfolio items are public

**How to configure**:
1. Settings → Privacy Settings
2. Toggle "Make my profile public" (limits to clients only)
3. Hide earnings statistics
4. Control portfolio visibility

### 3. **Business Entity**

**Legal Privacy Through Business Structure**:
- Register an LLC or business entity
- Use business name for branding
- Legal payments go to business
- Profile shows business name
- Personal name still required for verification

**Example**:
```
Legal Entity: JS Creative Solutions LLC
Owner: John Smith (verified, not public)
Profile Name: JS Creative Solutions
Client sees: Business name, not personal name
```

### 4. **Separate Work Identity**

**Professional Branding**:
- Use professional headshot (not personal photos)
- Brand yourself as a business
- Use business email addresses
- Professional bio without personal details
