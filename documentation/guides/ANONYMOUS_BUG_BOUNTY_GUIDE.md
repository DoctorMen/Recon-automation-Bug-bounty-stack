## 🚀 QUICK START (Do This Today)

### **Step 1: Create Anonymous Identity (30 minutes)**

```bash
# 1. Choose pseudonym
Examples: CyberGhost, ShadowHunter, VulnPhantom

# 2. Create encrypted email
Go to: https://proton.me/mail
Sign up with pseudonym (no phone required)
Enable 2FA

# 3. Get VPN
Recommended: Mullvad (https://mullvad.net/)
- No logs, accepts crypto
- $5/month
Install and always use BEFORE research

# 4. Sign up for HackerOne
URL: https://hackerone.com/users/sign_up
Username: YourPseudonym
Email: yourpseudonym@protonmail.com
Profile: No personal info
```

**You're now anonymous on the platform. Public doesn't know who you are.**

---

### **Step 2: Set Up Anonymous Payments (1-3 days)**

**Problem:** Platforms need to pay you legally (tax requirements)

**Solution: Anonymous LLC** ⭐ Best Method

```bash
# Why Wyoming LLC?
- No public member list (your name stays private)
- Strong privacy protections
- Low cost ($100/year)
- Fast setup (1-2 days online)

# Form LLC Online:
1. Go to: Northwest Registered Agent (privacy-focused)
   URL: https://www.northwestregisteredagent.com/

2. Choose: Wyoming LLC
   Cost: $39 (state) + $125 (registered agent) = $164/year

3. Name your LLC (generic, not your pseudonym):
   Examples:
   - "Alpine Security Consulting LLC"
   - "Mountain Cyber Services LLC"
   - "Evergreen Tech LLC"
   
4. Use their address (registered agent service)
   - Not your home address
   - They forward mail

5. Get EIN (Employer ID Number):
   - Free from IRS: https://www.irs.gov/ein
   - Apply online (5 minutes)
   - Use LLC name, not yours

6. Open business bank account:
   - Local bank or online (Mercury, Relay)
   - Bring: LLC formation docs + EIN letter
   - Account in LLC name only

7. Get business PayPal:
   - PayPal.com/business
   - Link to business bank account
   - Use business EIN

8. Update HackerOne payment:
   - Payment settings → Business account
   - Add business PayPal or bank info
   - Tax form: EIN (not your SSN)
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Public sees: Your pseudonym on HackerOne
- ✅ HackerOne pays: Your LLC (not your name)
- ✅ Money goes: Business bank account
- ✅ IRS knows: You own LLC (tax filing only)
- ✅ Your name: NEVER appears publicly

**Cost:** $164/year + ~$10/month bank fees

### **Step 3: Operational Security (Always)**

**Before ANY research:**

```bash
# ALWAYS use VPN
1. Open Mullvad VPN
2. Connect to server (Sweden, Switzerland, or Netherlands)
3. Verify IP changed: https://mullvad.net/check
4. THEN start research

# Browser privacy
Use Firefox with extensions:
- uBlock Origin (ad/tracker blocking)
- Privacy Badger (tracker protection)
- Clear cookies after each session

# Never mix identities
Personal device: Personal accounts only
Research device: Anonymous accounts only (if possible)

Or same device but:
- VPN always on for research
- Never log into personal accounts during research
- Use separate browser profiles
```

---

### **Step 4: Finding & Reporting Bugs**

**Choose Programs:**
```bash
# Good starting programs (public, beginner-friendly):
- Shopify
- PayPal
- Uber
- TikTok
- GitLab
- GitHub

# Check scope FIRST:
1. Read "Policy" tab completely
2. Look for "In Scope" domains
3. Check "Out of Scope" exclusions
4. Verify testing is allowed
```

**Report Template (Anonymous):**
```markdown
# SQL Injection in Search Parameter

## Summary
[2-3 sentences describing vulnerability]

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to https://target.com/search
2. Enter payload: ' OR 1=1--

```

---

### **Step 6: Taxes (Required)**

**The Reality:**
- ✅ Public doesn't know who you are (anonymous)
- ❌ IRS knows (legally required)

**Tax Filing:**

```
Year-end:
1. Download all payment records from HackerOne
2. Total your earnings: $X,XXX
3. File taxes:
   - If LLC: Form 1065 (Partnership) or 1120 (Corp)
   - Or: Single-member LLC = Schedule C (Self-Employment)
   
4. Report all income (even if anonymous)

Deductions:
- VPN subscription ($60/year)
- LLC fees ($164/year)
- Bank fees ($120/year)
- Computer equipment
- Internet costs (portion)
- Tools and software

Hire a CPA (recommended):
- Search: "cryptocurrency CPA" (they understand privacy)
- Cost: $300-500 for simple return
- Worth it to stay compliant
```

**⚠️  CRITICAL:** Tax evasion = Federal crime (5 years prison + fines)

**Anonymous ≠ Tax evasion**
- You can be anonymous to PUBLIC
- You MUST report income to IRS

### **Crypto Payments Setup:**

```bash
# 1. Get privacy wallet
Monero (XMR) recommended:
- Best privacy coin
- Untraceable transactions
- Download: https://www.getmonero.org/

# 2. Look for programs accepting crypto
Some HackerOne programs offer crypto
Private programs often accept BTC/ETH/XMR

Option B: Crypto debit card (BitPay)
Option C: Peer-to-peer exchange (LocalMonero)

# 4. STILL file taxes
Crypto income = taxable income
Keep records of:
- Date received
- Amount in USD (at time of receipt)
- What you did with it
```
