## Detailed Analysis

### Security Posture Assessment

**Strengths:**

- Cloudflare WAF protection on most endpoints
- HSTS implemented
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Modern web technologies

**Weaknesses:**

- Missing SameSite=Strict on cookies (CSRF risk)
- Potential DOM-based XSS via AddEventListener
- Limited attack surface due to extensive CloudFront protection

### Exploitation Opportunities

#### 1. Cookie Security (Low-Medium Risk)

**Finding:** Missing SameSite=Strict attribute

**Impact:** Potential CSRF attacks

**Affected:** affiliates.robinhood.com, press.robinhood.com

**Recommendation:** Implement SameSite=Strict on all cookies

#### 2. DOM XSS Potential (Informational)

**Finding:** AddEventListener usage detected

**Impact:** Potential DOM-based XSS if user input not sanitized

**Affected:** affiliates.robinhood.com, press.robinhood.com

**Recommendation:** Audit JavaScript for input sanitization

#### 3. Business Logic Testing (Recommended)

Given the limited technical attack surface, focus on:

- Affiliate program logic manipulation
- Press release distribution mechanisms
- Status page notification systems

## Attack Surface Mapping

### High-Value Targets (Score 10)

- admin.robinhood.com - HTTP 403 (CloudFront)
- admin.api.robinhood.com - HTTP 403 (CloudFront)

### Medium-Value Targets (Score 6)

- login.robinhood.com - HTTP 403 (CloudFront)
- login.api.robinhood.com - HTTP 403 (CloudFront)

### Exposed Services

- affiliates.robinhood.com - HTTPS 200 (Live)
- press.robinhood.com - HTTPS 200 (Live)
- status.robinhood.com - HTTPS 200 (Live)

## Recommendations for Further Testing

### 1. Authenticated Testing

Most critical functionality requires authentication:

- Obtain test credentials for internal testing
- Focus on API endpoints after authentication
- Test business logic in affiliate program

### 2. Supply Chain Analysis

- Investigate third-party dependencies
- Check for vulnerable JavaScript libraries
- Analyze CDN configurations

### 3. Social Engineering Vectors

- Phishing simulations using discovered brand elements
- Business email compromise analysis
- Employee training program assessment

### 4. Continuous Monitoring

- Monitor for new subdomains
- Track changes in security posture
- Automated vulnerability scanning

## Exploitation Pathways

### Path 1: Business Logic Focus

1. Register affiliate account
2. Test referral code manipulation
3. Analyze commission calculation logic
4. Test payout mechanisms

### Path 2: Supply Chain Investigation

1. Identify third-party services
2. Test for vulnerable dependencies
3. Check for API key exposure
4. Analyze data flows

### Path 3: Social Engineering

1. Harvest brand elements from press site
2. Create convincing phishing campaigns
3. Test employee awareness
4. Report findings responsibly

## Conclusion

The Robinhood Crypto infrastructure demonstrates strong perimeter security with extensive CloudFront protection. However, the limited exposed attack surface suggests:

1. **Focus on authenticated testing** for meaningful vulnerabilities
2. **Business logic testing** likely yields higher-value findings
3. **Supply chain analysis** may reveal indirect vulnerabilities
4. **Social engineering** remains a viable attack vector

No critical or high-severity vulnerabilities were discovered in the exposed services. The security posture appears robust from an external, unauthenticated perspective.

## NEW FINDINGS (API Hunting Phase)

### 1. Health Check Endpoint Exposure (Low-Medium)

**Finding:** Internal health check endpoints exposed and returning HTTP 500

**Affected URLs:**

- `https://affiliates.robinhood.com/healthcheck` → HTTP 500
- `https://press.robinhood.com/healthcheck` → HTTP 500

**Impact:**

- Information disclosure about backend service health
- May reveal stack traces or error messages under different conditions
- Could be used for service availability monitoring by attackers

**Recommendation:** Restrict access to health check endpoints or return proper 404

### 2. Impact.com Integration Data Exposure (Medium)

**Finding:** Affiliate program exposes tracking IDs in page source

**Exposed Data:**

- Owner ID: `3803961`
- Customer ID: `4213106`
- Page ID: `21426851`
- Variation data and tracking configuration

**Potential IDOR Testing:**

- Test ID enumeration on Impact.com platform
- Check if IDs can be manipulated to access other affiliate data
- Verify authorization on affiliate signup/management endpoints

**Business Logic Attack Vectors:**

1. Affiliate referral code manipulation
2. Commission tracking bypass
3. Multi-account abuse for referral bonuses

### 3. JavaScript Analysis Results

**Third-Party Services Identified:**

- Impact.com (Impact Radius) - Affiliate platform
- Instapage - Landing page builder
- Cloudflare - CDN/WAF
- Google Tag Manager - Analytics
- Google Fonts/Storage APIs

**Emails Discovered:**

- `creators@robinhood.com` (affiliate contact)
- `press@robinhood.com` (press contact)

### 4. API Endpoint Probe Summary

**affiliates.robinhood.com:**

- 58 endpoints tested
- 1 interesting finding (healthcheck 500)
- All API paths return 404

**press.robinhood.com:**
