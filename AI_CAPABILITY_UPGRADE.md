# 🤖 AI BUG BOUNTY CAPABILITY UPGRADE

## 🚀 WHAT WE JUST ADDED

Integrated **HackerOne's AI Bug Bounty Methodology** into your system.

This is MASSIVE because:
- ✅ AI vulnerabilities are the **HOTTEST, HIGHEST-PAYING category** right now
- ✅ Most security researchers don't know how to test AI systems
- ✅ AI bug bounties pay **2-5x more** than traditional web bugs
- ✅ **LOW COMPETITION** - new field, few experts

## 📊 BEFORE VS AFTER

### BEFORE (Traditional Web Security Only)
**Attack Surface:** Web apps, APIs, infrastructure  
**Capabilities:** Subdomain enum, vuln scanning, IDOR, XSS, SQLi  
**Market:** Mature (15+ years), high competition  
**Average bounty:** $500-2,000  
**Success rate:** 5-10% on hard targets  

### AFTER (Web + AI Security + AI Safety)

- Earns $500

YOU:
- Test web + AI
- Find 1 web + 2 AI bugs
- Earn $5,500

**Same time, 11x money**
